# Report - Nestor Escobedo -  Lab 1 part 2

# Problems encountered 
The main problem I encountered while doing this lab is the shared results variable that I used, I solved this problem 
by going into the example code provided and I got to correctly set that variable. 
I also had some issues with to run different threads on the command line but I realized it was just a syntax mistake.

It took me around 4 hours to solve this lab

# Performance 
1 thread = 8.09622607700112

2 threads = 5.430333714000881

4 threads = 3.3257547820012405

8 threads = 3.471053805000338

16 threads = 3.371013027999652

The time was gradually decreasing while the threads were increasing until the eight threads were used, at that point the time increase a little and at sixteen threads it decrease but not in a substantial way.
This means that probably the program will not decrease the time more than this.
