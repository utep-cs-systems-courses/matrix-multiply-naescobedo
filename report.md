# Matrix Report

This report describes the functioning and provides a sample testing of the matrix multiply program.


## Instructions
Run python program by using:
```sh
python3 matrixUtils.py
```
Then provide size of matrix and then the values of the two matrices to be multiplied
The program should output the time of the normal matrix multiplication and the blocked time.

```sh
Enter the size of the matrix: 256
Enter the value of first array: 3
Enter the value of second array: 4

121212121212121212
Matrix multiply time: 12.205709886009572 seconds
Blocked time: 3.088771139999153 seconds
```

The blocked size was faster than the normal matrix multiply algorithm
